            <h4>Grand Prismatic Spring</h4>
            <p class="price">
               The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park is the largest hot spring in the United States, 
               and the third largest in the world, after Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand and Boiling Lake in Dominica. 
               It is located in the Midway Geyser Basin.

         <div class="item two">
            <h4>Mammoth Hot Springs</h4>
            <p class="price">Mammoth is an incredibly popular spot because it has so much to offer: hot springs, a city, 
               a visitor center, Fort Yellowstone, a hospital, Roosevelt Arch (a few miles North), a campground, swimming in the boiling river, 
               and a lot of Elk hang out here.

               Inside Yellowstone - Midway Geyser Basin
               Midway hosts two of the largest thermal features of their types found anywhere in the world. 
               Grand Prismatic is a huge hot spring and Excelsior Geyser is one of the largest geysers. Duration: 1 minute 43 seconds

         <div class="item four">
            <h4>Old Faithful</h4>
            <p class="price">Old Faithful is one of nearly 500 geysers in Yellowstone and one of six that park rangers currently predict.
               It is uncommon to be able to predict geyser eruptions with regularity and Old Faithful has lived up to its name,
               only lengthening the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30 years.

         <div class="item five">
            <h4>Wild life</h4>
            <p class="price">
               The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the largest public herd of American bison in the United States. 
               Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, 
               and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds.

            <h4>Hiking in Yellowstone National Park</h4>
            <p class="price">
               When planning a hike, remember that many of Yellowstone’s trails are more than 7,000 feet above sea level. 
               Most areas retain snow until late May or early June, and some (especially mountain passes) 
               are snow-covered until late July.

         <div class="item seven">
            <h4>Visit Yellowstone during winter time</h4>
            <p class="price">
               Some of the best wildlife, geyser viewing, and photography opportunities arise in the dead of winter, 
               when the snow-white landscape provides the contrast that makes animals and 
               thermal wonders appear even more dramatic.

         <div class="item eight">
            <h4>Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</h4>
            <p class="price">
               The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River expresses the park's complex geologic history in dramatic colors and shapes. 
               Puffs of steam mark hydrothermal features in the canyon's walls. 
               The Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River add to the grandeur of the unique natural treasure.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="item nine">
            <h4>Yellowstone Lake</h4>
            <p class="price">
               This massive lake, its elevation about 7730 feet, covers 139 square miles, 
               and is 20 miles long by 14 miles wide. It has several large islands and some huge bays – 
               The Southeast Arm, South Arm, Flat Mountain Arm and West Thumb, all big enough to be lakes on their own.  
            </p>

         <div class="item ten">
            <h4>Unparalleled Scenic Beauty</h4>
            <p class="price">
               Yellowstone, the reigning champion among U.S. national parks, boasts landscapes of unparalleled beauty. 
               From towering mountains and plunging canyons to ancient forests and Yellowstone Lake, this park is a photographer’s, 
               and nature lover’s dream come true.
